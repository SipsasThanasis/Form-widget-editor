      <strong>Overview</strong><br />
      In this assignment, you're tasked with building a Form Widget Editor using a frontend
      framework of your choice. The editor will feature a sidebar for customizing form elements
      like a header, a subtitle, and various input fields. These changes should be reflected in
      real-time on a dynamic preview pane. The backend, built with NodeJS, will handle data
      persistence and HTML rendering via a message broker and a background worker.
